During this period, I learned to master the basics of four programming languages in two months: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (this website is actually made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Moreover, I have acquired skills in using various software such as GitHub, GitLab, Jupyter Notebook, VScode, PyCharm, Figma, Canva, Roboflow, Zapier, and Webflow, among others. I am now entering an AI work-study training program at Simplon and am looking for a company starting January 2026 to complete my training. My objective is to graduate with a Bac+5 and then work in ecology or medicine. I can't wait to learn more about AI with you! You can see below the work I have done so far:",

I recently completed a training program at emlyon business school in web development with project management basics and the Microsoft Office suite. I hold a general baccalaureate with honors, and after graduating, I built professional experience over 2 years working in sales and logistics in a hospital. On a personal level, I am passionate about photography, aesthetics, and especially new technologies and the world of IT. I am a creative person, but that doesn't stop me from having real rigor that I apply in my daily life and work. I aspire to train in the field of AI, with an apprenticeship at Simplon.",
